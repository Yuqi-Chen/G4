#Overview
#Batch download of files is available from a search result. When a set of experiments have been selected, click on the "Download" button to download a files.txt file that contains a list of URLs. The first URL in files.txt is to metadata.tsv, a file described below that contains all the experimental metadata for the files resulting from the search. The remaining URLs in files.txt are links that will download each ENCFF accessioned file.
#
#Files
#The "files.txt" file can be copied to any server. The following command can be used to download all the files in the list:
#
#xargs -n 1 curl -O -L < files.txt
#Please be prepared to receive several gigabytes of data if your search includes many files.
